# Nugget web socket server
(a copy of my repo on codeplex: https://nugget.codeplex.com/)

## Project Description
A web socket server implemented in c#.

The goal of the projects is to create an easy way to start using HTML5 web sockets in .NET web applications.

The project started as an article at The Code Project: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/webservices/c_sharp_web_socket_server.aspx.
It has been moved here to make it easier for others to contribute to the code and get the project going.
